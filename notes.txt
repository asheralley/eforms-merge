**Notes on eForms-merge**

*What I have done:
I have merged eForms-upgrade into eForms-tron by adding all html, css, js and image files accross and making a new
repo called eforms-merge. I added the files to the root dir as well as into the html folder.
After moving all files to the new eforms-merge repo the necessary file paths were renamed as listed below

Due to conflicts with file names as well as Bootstrap versions I renamed several files:
1. custom.min.css to custom-upgrade.min.css.
2. bootstrap.min.css to bootstrap-upgrade.min.css
3. bundle.js to bundle-upgrade.js
4. custom.js to custom-upgrade.js

*Issues
Bootstrap version:
As mentioned above there is a Bootstrap version discrepancy between eForms-upgrade and eForms-tron. EForms-tron in
on Bootstrap 4.1.0 where as eForms-upgrade is on Bootstrap 3.3.5. Eforms-upgrade may need to be migrated
to Bootstrap 4.1.0 at some stage?


*Possible updates => Future Development
Currently the gulpfile is not been re-written for development and is still set up for eForms-tron. At some
stage we will need to amend it to allow for the eForms-upgrade file paths. I have included the eForms-upgrade
gulp directory into eforms-merge and renamed it as gulp-upgrade.
